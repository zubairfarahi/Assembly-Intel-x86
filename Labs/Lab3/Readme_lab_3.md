# Lab 3

Basic programs written in Assembly

## 0-warm-ups

- simple exercises, to observe the SASM function and the code in the Assembly

## 1-2-hello-world

- Assembly program that displays `` Hello, World! '' and then `` Goodbye, World! ''

## 3-grumpy-jumps

- examples of the use of `` jmp '' conditioned packages

## 4-sets

- low level BitSet simulation, using a 32 bit number

- operations were implemented
- addition
- elimination
- meeting
- intersection
- the difference
- complement

## 5-min

- the minimum of 2 numbers ... trivial, csf?

## 6-fibonacci

- calculation of the `` n`` Fibonacci term, iterative in `` O (n) ''

- for implementation in `` O (logn) '', see [variant with logarithmic matrix exponents] (https://github.com/teodutu/IOCLA/blob/master/Snippets/fibonacci_lgput.asm)

## examples

- very simple examples of Assembly functioning
