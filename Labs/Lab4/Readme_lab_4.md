Multiplication operations, division, vectors and the `` loop '' instruction

## 0 recap

- the decomposition of a number into powers of 2

## 1-2-multiply

- multiplying 2 numbers that activate `` CF '', at the level of:
- `` byte ''
- `` word ''
- `` dword ''

## 3-4 in sum

- gathering the premiums in numbers using the `` loop ''

- assembly of squares `` loop '', stack, implemented in 4/7 Assembly instructions

## 5-6-7-sum-array

- sum of elements in vectors with type elements:
- `` byte ''
- `` word ''
- `` dword ''

- sum of the squared elements of a `` dword '' vector, implemented on the model from [the previous exercise] (https://github.com/teodutu/IOCLA/blob/master/Labs/Lab4/3-4-sum-n /sum_n_square.asm)

## 8-divide

- exemplifying the operation of partitioning with rest in Assembly (`` div '') by data types:
- `` byte ''
- `` word ''
- `` dword ''
- `` qword``

## 9-extract-from-vect

- the number of numbers seems odd and even from a vector (the `` test '' instruction)

- the number of positive and negative numbers in a vector (the `` cmp '' statement)
