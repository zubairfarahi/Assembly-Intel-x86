All themes were put on the git ** after the deadline **. 
## HW 1 - postfixed Polish expression evaluation - the title explains everything 

## Hw 2 - xor-based encryption - various (6) simple encryption algorithms, based on the byte xor byte operation with a key between and a string 

## Hw 3 - optimizations - starting from a given binary, the mystery set of functions will be optimized once for a minimum execution time and then for a minimum size.
